Existing travel websites offer a myriad of options, but the lack of personalization makes it challenging for users to find the perfect travel itinerary that aligns with their preferences and interests. Additionally, travelers often face difficulties in optimizing their budget, lack reliable insights on hidden gems and local experiences, and struggle to adjust their plans in real-time during their journey.
